      <h2>How I started doing art</h2>
      <p> I started getting an interest in graffiti when I was in sophomore year of high school.
        I really liked walking home and always seeing different names and different styles portrayed in the
        buildings. I didn't know anyone who has done graffiti, and i didnt know exactly what to expect.
        I started off by think of a name, something unique but something I was already familiar with. I came
        across this movie from my childhood called "Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory"(1971). There is
        this scene in the movie where Wonka shows the kids fruit wallpaper, you are able to lick it and taste
        like the fruit. Wonka later goes and says "Try some more, the strawberries taste like strawberries,
        the SNAWZberries taste like SNAWZberries." This is how I got my name. SNAWZ

      <h3>Practice</h3>
      <p>  I usually like using paint markers on old vinyls to write my name. I want to learn how to do animal portraits.
       I'm having a bit of a hard time with charcoal pencils, thats one of my goals
        this year is to better my skills in drawing with charcoal.

      <h3>Now</h3>
      <p> Now, I don't really do alot of art, except in the weekends, I meet up with my friends and paint
        permission walls to practice our spray paint techniques. In the future I hope to do a mural in my
        community. This is a hobby I plan to keep for a long time.

      <h3>Herbal Practice</h3>
      <p>Something that has really caught my eye is the study of plants and the use
        of herbs. I plan to further study my cultures herbal techniques as a way to connect 
        with my roots. When I went Mexico, my dad and my stepmom opened a path i would've
        never thought i would be intrigued to. They showed me herbs that were used to protect
        us from people being envious from us, we call this the "evil eye."
